#LOAN APPROVAL PREDICTION
1) What is a loan prediction system?
A mechanism called the Loan Prediction System allows you to apply for loans and receive notifications when they are approved. By the data provided by the applicant, the system notifies the applicant of the loan's availability.

2) What is Numpy?
NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.It also has functions for working in the domain of linear algebra and matrices. It is an open-source project and you can use it freely. NumPy stands for Numerical Python.

3)What is Pandas?
 Pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.

4) What is Matplotlib?
Python scripts can be used to create 2D graphs and plots using the Matplotlib module. With features to control line styles, font attributes, formatting axes, and other features, it offers a module called plot that makes things simple for plotting.


## Project Description

*This project focuses on predicting loan approval outcomes using machine learning techniques in Python.
*The goal is to build a robust model that can assess the creditworthiness of loan applicants, facilitating quicker and more accurate loan decisions.

### Prerequisites

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook 
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, etc. (List required libraries and versions)

## Usage

1. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook files to explore and understand the loan approval prediction process.
2. Follow the project's step-by-step guide to build and evaluate loan approval prediction models.
3. Customize and fine-tune the models to suit your specific use case or dataset.
4. Use the trained models for loan approval predictions.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Sample datasets or data sources used in the project.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebook files with code and explanations.
- `models/`: Saved machine learning models (if applicable).
- - `scripts/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
